               Iceland is intense, in a totally good way. It’s hard to imagine just how wild it is until you get out into its wild spaces but, given that 80 percent of the country is uninhabited, this doesn’t take long.

                            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                                          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres                                          </p>

                                          <p class="text">Surfing is an amazing sport with an impressive history. The exact origins of surfing are not certain, but it was first observed by Europeans on a ship in Tahiti back in 1767.

                                                        Research suggests that surfing dates back to the ancient Polynesian cultures that existed long ago. According to data collected and many myths, the chief of a tribe was the man who could surf the best.  <br> <br>
                                                        In other words, the top wave rider was the top man in his community. That says a lot about how important surfing was in the lives of the ancients.

                                                        Hawaiian surfing has a rich tradition. The ancient Hawaiian inhabitants looked as surfing as an integral part of life. It was not just a hobby or a job. It was a way of life and an art form for them.
                                                        
                                                        Constructing a surfboard was a spiritual process, and great care went into all things related to surfing. The people were fascinated with the concept of taming the ocean and discovering the mysteries buried beneath the powerful waves.
